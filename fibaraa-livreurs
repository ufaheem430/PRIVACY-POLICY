We collect precise or approximate location data from drivers’ and delivery persons’ mobile devices when the Fibaraa driver app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).


Location data (riders and order recipients).
We collect precise or approximate location information from riders’ and order recipients’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so via their device settings.

However, this may affect certain features in the Fibaraa Market apps. For example, a rider who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their pickup address. In addition, precise location data collected from a driver’s device during a trip is linked to the rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device. This data is used for purposes such as receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.
